My Dotfiles Repository

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. Originally, these dotfiles were used on Debian Unstable, but they are now primarily used on Arch Linux.

After a fresh installation, I clone this repository into my home directory and use stow script to create symbolic links.

Some stuff comes from other public dotfiles, which I found useful and added them into this repository.
